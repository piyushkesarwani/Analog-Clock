# Analog-Clock
This is an analog clock made from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Basic functionality here is that I've used the Date(), getMinutes(), getSeconds(), and getHours() function in JavaScript which are the built-in functions in JavaScript. Next I've just use the Rotation login and set property methods in JavaScript to made this simple, yet beautiful clock.
